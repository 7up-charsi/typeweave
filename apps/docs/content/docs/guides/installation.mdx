## configure Tailwind css

Webbo-ui is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official installation guide to install Tailwind CSS. Then follow the steps below.

<Steps>
### Install theme package
To install, run following command in your terminal

```bash
pnpm add @webbo-ui/theme
```

### add theme plugin

then configure it in your <Highlight>tailwindcss.config.ts</Highlight>, like this...

Leave `content` array as is we will modify it later.

```ts
import { webboUi } from '@webbo-ui/theme';

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // your stuff...
  ],
  plugins: [webboUi()],
};
```

</Steps>

## main react package

The easiest way to get started is to use the React package. It downloads all components and export them from one file. So you can import any component from one package.

Asume you have configured tailwindcss as above then follow the steps below.

<Steps>
### Install react Package

To install, run following command in your terminal

```bash
pnpm add @webbo-ui/react
```

### tailwind css styles

you need to import styles from <Highlight>@webbo-ui/theme</Highlight> for components. you are using main react package so you need to import full library styles.

add this in your `content` array

```txt
'./node_modules/@webbo-ui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
```

### import any component

then you can import and use any componet you want from <Highlight>@webbo-ui/react</Highlight>

```tsx
import { Button } from '@webbo-ui/react'

export default funtion App() {
  return <Button>webbo-ui</Button>
}
```

</Steps>

## individual component

You can install each package separately. This is useful if you want to reduce the size of your CSS bundle as it will only include styles for the components you're actually using.

Asume you have configured tailwindcss as above then follow the steps below.

<Steps>
### install component

Now, let's install the component you want to use. For example, if you want to use the Button component, you need to run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm add @webbo-ui/button
```

### tailwind css styles

you need to import styles from <Highlight>@webbo-ui/theme</Highlight> for component. you are using components individually so you need to import styles separately. These <Highlight>style paths</Highlight> are given at every compnent page for you so you can copy and paste them.

As we are using Button component so add this in your `content` array for button styles.

```txt
'./node_modules/@webbo-ui/theme/dist/components/button.js',
```

### import component

then you can import and use componet.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@webbo-ui/react'

export default funtion App() {
  return <Button>webbo-ui</Button>
}
```

</Steps>

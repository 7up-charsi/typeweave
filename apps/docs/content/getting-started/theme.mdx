# Theme Customization

Easily customize theme using our plugin. The plugin works by modifying CSS variables, which are then injected into CSS and utilized by component styles.

## Prerequisites

Before customizing theme colors, ensure you have [@radix-ui/colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) installed. Plugin relies on Radix UI colors, bypassing Tailwind CSS's default palette.

## Customizing

To tailor your theme, navigate to tailwind.config.ts and provide a configuration object to the plugin. The plugin accepts only one configuration parameter, enabling you to override all default theme values and create a fully customized theme from scratch

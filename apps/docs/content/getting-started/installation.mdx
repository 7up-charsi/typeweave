## Installation

To install **@typeweave/react** in your project, simply run one of these:

```bash
pnpm add @typeweave/react @typeweave/plugin
```

```bash
npm install @typeweave/react @typeweave/plugin
```

```bash
yarn add @typeweave/react @typeweave/plugin
```

## Usage

1. Configure **@typeweave/plugin** in `tailwind.config.js`:

**Important Note:**

When importing styles, please be aware of the following distinction:

- Use `./node_modules/@typeweave/react/dist/COMPONENT_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME.styles.js` to only include one component styles, allowing TailwindCSS to generate optimized CSS for that specific component.

  Replace `COMPONENT_NAME` with your actual component name in **lowercase** and **kebab case** (e.g. `my-component`).

- Use `./node_modules/@typeweave/react/dist/**/*.styles.js` to include styles for all components. **Note that this approach will result in a significantly larger CSS file size**, as it includes styles for all components, even if you're only using the one component. This may impact page load times and performance.
  Choose the appropriate import to optimize your TailwindCSS setup and minimize CSS file size!

```js
import { typeweave } from '@typeweave/plugin';

export default {
  content: [
    './node_modules/@typeweave/react/dist/button/button.styles.js',
  ], // styles for button component
  plugins: [typeweave()],
};
```

and in your **globals.css**

```css
@layer base {
  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground;
  }
}
```

This configuration registers the styles of **Button** component and sets body background and text color.

2. Import components from **@typeweave/react**

**Important Note:**

**@typeweave/react** does not provide a main export. Instead, i recommend importing components directly from their respective files to leverage tree shaking and optimize bundle size.

**Incorrect:** `import { COMPONENT_NAME } from '@typeweave/react'`

**Correct:** `import { COMPONENT_NAME } from '@typeweave/react/COMPONENT_NAME'`

Replace `COMPONENT_NAME` with your actual component name in **Pascal case** (e.g. `MyComponent`).

By importing components directly, you can take advantage of tree shaking and only include the components you need in your build, reducing unnecessary code and optimizing performance.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@typeweave/react/button';
import "./globals.css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onPress={() => alert('Hello, TypeWeave!')}>Press me</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
